PushType is a **new and modern content management system** for **Ruby on Rails**.  It takes advantage of powerful new features available in the latest versions of Rails and PostgreSQL, resulting in a fantastically flexible toolset for developers working on any kind of website.

It is distributed as a [Rails Engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) so can integrate with your existing application or be used in a new app as a standalone CMS.

## Why use PushType?

Just what the world needs, right? Another content management system!

Well, yes actually. The Ruby eco-system isn't exactly endowed with amazing choice when it comes to content managment. And the recent `jsonb` datatype features provided by [PostgreSQL 9.4](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/release-9-4.html) opens up a world of possibilities that PushType is first in line to take full advantage of.

Key benefits include:

* Create **custom structures and hierarchies of different types of content**, with jaw-dropping simplicity.
* A bucketload of built-in **field types** and a simple API to create your own custom fields.
* A simple, **easy to use** and modern admin UI built on [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), that you can actually be proud to present to your clients.
* PushType does the content and then gets out of your way. **Just use Rails** to develop all that bespoke functionality every project demands. No hacking required.

Underpinning everything PushType aims to be is a philosophy that puts you, the developer first. You're the ones getting your fingers dirty, bashing those keys for hours on end to deliver your client's requirements. Your job should be made easier by the tools you chose to work with.

Many CMS products are pitched towards website owners and designed accordingly. **We unashamedly put the developer at the forefront of every design decision we make**.

  <h3>Pre-v1 development</h3>
  <p>PushType is still in a relatively early phase of development. Brave pioneering developers are welcome, but until version 1 is released:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Expect rough edges aplenty (please raise issues)</li>
    <li>Breaking changes may be introduced with little warning</li>
    <li>Documentation may not be complete or up to date</li>
  </ul>
