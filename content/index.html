  <h2>What is PushType?</h2>
  <p>PushType is a new and modern content management system for Ruby and Rails. It takes advantage of powerful new features available in the latest versions of Rails and PostgreSQL, resulting in a fantastically flexible toolset for developers working on any kind of website.</p>
  <p>Underpinning everything PushType aims to be is a philosophy that puts you, the developer first. A core belief behind every design decision we make is that your job should be made easier by the tools you chose to work with.</p>
  <p>PushType has been lovingly developed by Push Code Ltd and now we want to give it to you. We're looking to establish a community of developers who can build upon what we've started and help give the Rails world the CMS it's been waiting for.</p>
